## [Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41022133-colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage) 

by Haruki Murakami

Sometimes a victim is required. I found this book haunting and strange, like most Murakami books. I felt for Tsukuru--I've never been cut off by my friends like he was, but I have had friends slip away and not want to reconnect, and it hurts in a peculiar way. The book also dealt with many other recurrent Murakami themes, like the reality of dreams, and how culpable we are for the things our subconscious generates. I also have no idea what to make of Haida's father's story, or how it (or, really, Haida's character in general) connected to everything.

It also made me think about the path-dependence of life, the way that who we are is entirely dependent on the twists of turns of life that led us up to the present moment, and how we can't undo the past without undoing who we are today.

## [The Vegetarian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489025-the-vegetarian) 

by Han Kang

I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. It's such a strange story about sadness and trauma and control and the pressure society puts on people, especially women. I think I liked it, and I _think_ I understood at least some of what it was trying to say, but ngl I'm not 100% sure. Probably the mark of a pretty good book.

## [The Elegance of the Hedgehog](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2967752-the-elegance-of-the-hedgehog) 

by Muriel Barbery

Another sad book that I liked a lot. I find it hard to believe that someone like Renée would really be able to hide her intelligence for so many years, but maybe I am underestimating the French class system and the invisibility of people like her within it. I wish there had been more time with Paloma and Renée together. The end was beautiful, though.


## [The Nakano Thrift Shop](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32919876-the-nakano-thrift-shop)

by Hiromi Kawakami

I liked this book a lot, though the characters--mostly Hitomi, the narrator, and Takeo--sometimes frustrated me with their inability to express how they felt, and how much pain that caused them both. Conversely, I found myself quite engaged with Masayo, Mr. Nakano's sister. Overall, it was a well-told little story of love between unusual people in an unexpected place, and one that reminded me of brief moments in my working life when it felt like my coworkers and I were a strange, dysfunctional but loving family.

## [Convenience Store Woman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36739755-convenience-store-woman) 

by Sayaka Murata 

I loved this. I'm not neurodivergent in any serious way myself, but I felt like the struggle that Keiko went through to fit in, to find a place in the world where she would be accepted rather than judged, and where she would feel that she was a useful member of society, was a tiny, extreme version of the struggle that we all face. The end, in particular, with the Shinto-ish sensation of the convenience store speaking through her, telling the world how it wished to be, was touching.

## [Pushkin Hills](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1052017.Pushkin_Hills) 

by Sergei Dovlatov

I wanted to like this book more than I did. I appreciate the character portraits, and I liked the overall rhythm of the book, but I found the wealth of references to Russian literature a little too heavy (and seemingly important to the mood) for me to follow. Or at least that's how I felt, as if I wasn't quite following it.
