* [The Elegance of the Hedgehog](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2967752-the-elegance-of-the-hedgehog) by Muriel Barbery (4 stars): Another sad book that I liked a lot. I find it hard that someone like Renée would really be able to hide her intelligence, but maybe I am underestimating the French class system, and the invisibility of people like her. I wish there had been more time with Paloma and Renée together. The end was beautiful, though.
* [The Nakano Thrift Shop](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32919876-the-nakano-thrift-shop) by Hiromi Kawakami (4 stars): I liked this book a lot, though the characters--mostly Hitomi, the narrator, and Takeo--sometimes frustrated me with their inability to express how they felt, and how much pain that caused them both. Conversely, I found myself quite engaged with Masayo, Mr. Nakano's sister. Overall, it was a well-told little story of love between unusual people in an unexpected place, and one that reminded me of brief moments in my working life when it felt like my coworkers and I were a strange, dysfunctional but loving family.
* [Convenience Store Woman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36739755-convenience-store-woman) by Sayaka Murata (4.5 stars): I loved this. I'm not neurodivergent in any serious way myself, but I felt like the struggle that Keiko went through to fit in, to find a place in the world where she would be accepted rather than judged, and where she would feel that she was a useful member of society, was a tiny, extreme version of the struggle that we all face. The end, in particular, with the Shinto-ish sensation of the convenience store speaking through her, telling the world how it wished to be, was touching.
* [Pushkin Hills](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1052017.Pushkin_Hills) by Sergei Dovlatov (3.5 stars): I wanted to like this book more than I did. I appreciate the character portraits, and I liked the overall rhythm of the book, but I found the wealth of references to Russian literature a little too heavy (and seemingly important to the mood) for me to follow. Or at least that's how I felt, as if I wasn't quite following it.
