## [The End of October](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52669505-the-end-of-october)

by Lawrence Wright

There was a time when I read nothing but technothrillers, but it's been a while. This was a good book, and it's somewhat amazing that it came out before Covid-19 but predicted so much of what would happen with it. Thankfully, Covid-19 wasn't Kongoli, but it could have been, and we would have been just as screwed. We might yet be just as screwed if we don't get our act together. It's frightening. 

## [My Year of Rest and Relaxation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279110-my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation)

by Ottessa Moshfegh

I really liked this book. In a way that probably isn't particularly flattering for me, I identified with the narrator. I identified with just wanting to sleep, to rest, to detach. She is almost entirely unlikeable, and there's no way we'd actually be friends in real life, but I respect it. The very last few sentences are haunting.

## [Weather](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37506228-weather) 

by Jenny Offill

Reading this immediately after _I'm Thinking of Ending Things_ was a pleasant change of pace. The narrator's mind sounded a lot like my mind does sometimes. There was a lot in this small book--sadness and fear and hope and loss and the sort of mundane problems that people have. The feeling of existential dread about the warming Earth and the slow slide back to fascism we seem to have embarked upon. The light thread of Buddhism stretching through all of it.

## [I'm Thinking of Ending Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40605223-i-m-thinking-of-ending-things)

by Iain Reid

Creepy pychological thrillers aren't normally my thing, but I liked this story well enough. I thought that the foreshadowing was a bit heavy, and there were things that seemed like horror movie clich√© for no apparent reason, but way the ending came together was satisfying. It was also creepy enough that I'd recommend you _not_ read the last quarter or so of it while walking through your neighborhood in the dark at 5am.

## [Sea of Tranquility](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58446227-sea-of-tranquility)

by Emily St. John Mandel

I think I had read some of this book before, but I never finished it. I'm a sucker for pandemic books and a sucker for time travel books and a sucker for "we're living in a simulation" books, so this one really hit the spot. I would love to have more time to understand more about the various worlds depicted in the story, but I appreciate that it didn't dwell to much on the setting, but kept moving forward as more and more of the story made sense.

## [Three Days in June](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213243949-three-days-in-june) 

by Anne Tyler

This was a lovely little book. I'm not sure what I expected, but I appreciated the gradual opening of Gail and Max's backstory, and the exploration of the tensions in marriage, identity, and family.

## [Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133938826-welcome-to-the-hyunam-dong-bookshop) 

by Hwang Bo-Reum

Apparently I'm addicted to books about life and love amongst small shops in Asia. I liked how all of the characters moved forward, but none of them "ended" anywhere, which was sort of the point of the book, I suppose--life isn't a goal, it's a process, and there's no finish line. I want so much to go to this bookshop and sit amongst these people.

## [The Ministry of Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199798179-the-ministry-of-time) 

by Kaliane Bradley

This was a great read. I can tell an audiobook is good when the miles I'm putting on my feet while listening slip by entirely unnoticed while I'm immersed in the story. I'm a sucker for a well-told time travel story, and I appreciated the slowly deepening relationship between the narrator and Graham, as well as the commentary on colonialism. It also introduced me to the world of [real-person fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction), though it's a bit of a stretch to call it fan fiction for a sailor who died 175 years ago. 

## [I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49228706-i-want-to-die-but-i-want-to-eat-tteokpokki)

by Baek Se-hee

I mostly chose this book because of the title. I'm not sure what I expected, and while I related to many of the travails of the author, I didn't find that I connected particularly well with her. I can very much imagine that someone going through depression like hers would, though, and that it would be a comfort.

## [A Man Called Ove](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove) 

by Fredrik Backman

Ove reminded me so much of my maternal grandfather in many ways, though I think Ove had been through worse and turned out better, but the portrait of a man who believed so strongly in the power of work to answer all of life's questions that he didn't understand how to face life in any other way resonated deeply with me. It's a _little_ bit hard to believe that someone just 59 years old had hardended so much, but perhaps I'm just fortunate to not be formed by the kinds of hardships that form men like him. I especially liked his relationship with Mirsad, and how it showed that not knowing the right words (which in many circles would have immediately caused him to be shunned) was so much less important than the actions of his heart.
